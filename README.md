# Arduino Shell

A command shell to interact with built-in Arduino features via the Serial Monitor.

Right now it offers commands:

* to print EEPROM contents in a hexdump-like form
* to write bytes into EEPROM
* to configure the pins for digital I/O mode
* to save the pin configuration to EEPROM
* to print the current pin configuration

Also useful, a super-simple command parser class that breaks a raw input string into 
a command and parameters, which can then be used by other logic to determine the 
next steps.

## Startup

At startup, the saved pin configuration is reloaded and digital I/O pins are restored
to their last HIGH or LOW voltage level.

## Command Examples

### `help`

Prints out the commands that are available the be played with.

Config Shell commands:
    config print
    config save

Digital Pin Shell commands:
    pin <n> in
    pin <n> in_pullup
    pin <n> high
    pin <n> low
    pin <n> status
    pin <n> reset

EEPROM Shell commands:
    p
    p <address>
    p <address> <rows>
    wb <address> <byte-value> -- writes the byte-value to the address
```

### `config print`

Prints the currently running pin configuration, like so:

```
config print
ConfigBlock CRC: 0000b2b1
Config for Pin 00: DIGITAL_INPUT
Config for Pin 01: DIGITAL_OUTPUT_HIGH
Config for Pin 02: DIGITAL_INPUT_PULLUP
Config for Pin 03: DIGITAL_OUTPUT_LOW
[...]
Config for Pin 61: NO_TYPE
Config for Pin 62: NO_TYPE
Config for Pin 63: NO_TYPE
```

The config system does not do any checking whether the pins actually 
exist on your Arduino, so be careful.

### `config save`

Saves the configuration to EEPROM with a CRC checksum of the pin 
configuration.

### `pin <n> in`

Sets the pin to `INPUT` mode and that's all.

### `pin <n> in_pullup`

Sets the pin to `INPUT_PULLUP` mode and that's all.

### `pin <n> high`

Sets the pin to `OUTPUT` mode and sets the voltage level to `HIGH`.

### `pin <n> low`

Sets the pin to `OUTPUT` mode and sets the voltage level to `LOW`.

### `pin <n> status`

Prints the current setting of the pin. Useful for scripting. One of:

```
    "NO_TYPE",
    "DIGITAL_INPUT",
    "DIGITAL_INPUT_PULLUP",
    "DIGITAL_OUTPUT_HIGH",
    "DIGITAL_OUTPUT_LOW",
    "ANALOG_INPUT",
    "PWM",
    "SERIAL_HARDWARE",
    "SERIAL_SOFTWARE",
    "SERIAL_CAN",
    "SERIAL_I2C",
    "SERIAL_SPI"
```

### `pin <n> reset`

Resets the pin to `NO_TYPE` mode, which means that when the Arduino
is reset, there is no configuration performed on this pin.

### `wb address byte`

Write the `byte` to the specified EEPROM `address`.

```
wb 0x51 0x45
command:  >>wb<<
param[0]: >>0x51<<
param[1]: >>0x45<<
0050 | FF 45 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | .E..............      
```

### `p address rows`

Print `rows` rows, starting from EEPROM `address`.

```
p 0x00 10
command:  >>p<<
param[0]: >>0x00<<
param[1]: >>10<<
0000 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ................      
0010 | 42 41 43 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | BAC.............      
0020 | 47 51 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | GQ..............      
0030 | 57 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | W...............      
0040 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 44 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ........D.......      
0050 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ................      
0060 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ................      
0070 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ................      
0080 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ................      
0090 | FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF | ................      
```

# Building

Make sure to copy the `platform.local.txt` file to the correct Arduino IDE folder, 
to enable C++11 compilation support:
On Linux, that folder is inside the Arduino IDE directory tree at 
`arduino-1.6.5-r5/hardware/arduino/avr`. On Windows and OS X, it's in a similar subfolder.
